# KcalControler

## Description
I created website about controling calories in diet. I choose this topic because I was currently interested in healthy lifestyle and I want to do useful website about it, so here it is.
It helps to calculate your energy demands and explain how it works and show many other things that linked into this subject. It's my first project and I really enjoyed it. Also this project
