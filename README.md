# KcalControler

## Description
I created website about controling calories in diet. I choose this topic because I was currently interested in healthy lifestyle and I want to do useful website about it, so here it is.
It helps to calculate your energy demands and explain how it works and show many other things that linked into this subject. It's my first project and I really enjoyed it. Also important to mention that project was created for training and learning purposes.

## Build with
- HTML
- CSS
- Less
- JavaScript

## Roadmap
- use local storage to save and load preferences about website color-scheme;
- add back to top button on pages;
- add multilanguage support;
- add more content;

## Project Status
On this moment I do not longer support this. I will try new things and keep learning.
